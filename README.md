# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to a very short course that covers introductory machine learning and some basic R coding. 

To get started make sure you have downloaded [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Then, open up Rstudio and in the Console window type:
`install.packages(c('dplyr', 'readr', 'mlr', 'randomForest', 'h2o'))`

If you have problems installing `h2o`, you might need a copy of [Java  JDK](https://www.oracle.com/ie/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

If all works well, you are now ready to start the course. Download all the files for the course by clicking [here](https://github.com/andrewcparnell/intro_to_ml/archive/master.zip). Unzip this file and then double click on the `Intro_to_ml.Rproj` file. You can now start coding!

All the slides for the course are available in pdf format [here](https://github.com/andrewcparnell/intro_to_ml/raw/master/intro_slides.pdf)
